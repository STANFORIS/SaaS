# Stanforis Rwanda - National Life Digital Mirror Project
<!-- This system is intended to be represented to the National of Rwanda once complete -->


**Author:** IRABARUTA Aminadabu
**Company:** Stanforis Research & Scientific Authority
**Product:** Stanforis Rwanda - Multi-Tenant SaaS Platform
**Version:** 1.0.0
**Purpose:** Build a living, national-scale digital twin of Rwanda, covering multiple sectors, with integrated IoT, microservices, dashboards, and citizen/enterprise services.




Key Concepts of its UNIQUENESS
<!-- Main Purposes Open here -->
## Self-contained runtime: Frontend + backend compiled together
Nationwide interoperability via REST/gRPC gateways.
## Microservices: Each sector operates independently but can sync via APIs/WebSockets
## Security: Backend logic compiled to native code, not exposed in source
## Cross-platform foccussed more on: Mobile, Web, IoT-ready
## AI / ML modules integration
## IoT device communication via MQTT/WebSocket
## Really Real-time dashboards

* **3D / GIS Integration:** For urban planning, residential migration, and infrastructure visualization
* **IoT Telemetry:** More Sectors such as Energy, transport, agriculture etc, security sensors feed into APIs
* **Event Bus:** Hive MQTT broker + Firebase real-time push for cross-sector events
* **Analytics Layer:** Predictive micro modeling AIs
* **Notifications / IoT:** WebSocket / MQTT for real-time data

- Local DB (SQLite / Hive / Isar)
- Offline & Real-time Sync
- Native APIs (Sensors, GPS, Camera, etc)

a) Each micro-frontend (sector) have its own routing internally
b) Within each sector, dashboards and admin pages are integrated and self-managed.
c) Centralized routing for microservices backend.
d) Each sector microservice exposes APIs; the gateway directs requests to the correct service.
e) Supports authentication, logging, and throttling at a central point.
f) Each micro-frontend deployed independently
g) Shared components (UI, auth, notifications) published as a shared library

<!-- Main Gateway -->

## main.dart * → loads sector micro-frontends dynamically
## Each sector has its own DB/microservice, integrated through the API gateway
Embedding of Rust/Imbended languages nodes Microservices microservices through FFI

<!-- 

Language: Dart
Engine: Skia + ....
Platforms: Android,  Web.

Responsibilities: 
Dynamic UI rendering for all devices

## 6. Databases & Data Layers

This system embraces a polyglot persistence model: choose the right tool for each job.

### 6.1 Edge / Local (Device & Mobile)

* **Isar**: high-performance embedded DB written in Rust with a Dart client — recommended for offline-first Flutter apps.
* **SQLite + Drift**: reliable SQL for structured local storage.
* **Hive**: simpler key-value alternatives for small caches.

**Example:** Use Isar for per-user caches, local indexes, and short-term telemetry buffering.

### 6.2 Sector Microservice Tier

* **PostgreSQL + PostGIS**: primary ACID transactional store for core state (identity, finance, land registry).
* **SurrealDB**: hybrid document/graph SQL engine for flexible domain models and real-time subscriptions.
* **MongoDB**: for flexible, rapidly changing telemetry schemas.

**Multi-tenancy:** Prefer PostgreSQL schemas or separate logical databases per tenant depending on isolation needs.

### 6.3 Central Data Lake / Analytics

* **ClickHouse**: analytics and dashboarding (fast columnar reads)
* **TimescaleDB**: long-term time-series data, leveraging PostgreSQL toolchain
* **InfluxDB**: device telemetry ingestion (optional)
* **Neo4j / SurrealDB Graph Mode**: national-scale relationship maps
* **MinIO (S3)**: object storage for raw files and ML datasets

**Stream ingestion:** Kafka connectors (Kafka Connect) to move topics into ClickHouse/TimescaleDB/S3.
---

## 7. Eventing, Messaging & Streaming

**Device Layer:** MQTT brokers (HiveMQ / EMQX) accept telemetry from sensors and gateways.

**System Bus:** Apache Kafka is the recommended central event bus for:

* durable event storage
* decoupled microservices
* stream processing (Kafka Streams / Flink)

**Pattern:** Devices → MQTT → Rust Edge → Kafka Topics → Consumers (Microservices, Analytics, AI)

**Topic design guidance:**

* Use stable topic naming: `org.country.sector.resource.action` (e.g., `rwa.energy.grid.voltage`)
* Partition by geographic region or tenant where high throughput is expected
* Respect schema evolution: use Protobuf/Avro with registered schemas (Schema Registry)

---

## 8. API & Interoperability (X-Road Inspired)

The design follows an X-Road-like interoperability model:

* **Gateway registry:** Central metadata registry listing services, endpoints, auth metadata
* **Service contracts:** All services publish OpenAPI/Proto definitions
* **Secure transport:** Mutual TLS between inter-service calls; token exchange for end-users
* **Audit & logging:** Every transaction is logged with trace IDs for verifiability

**Interfaces:**

* **gRPC** for internal, high-throughput calls
* **GraphQL** optional for UI-driven queries
* **REST** for simple integrations and external partners

**Service discovery:** Use a proven service mesh (Istio) .

---

## 9. Security, Privacy & Data Sovereignty

Security is non-negotiable. This section lists key controls and patterns.

### 9.1 Data Sovereignty

* Prefer hosting in local, Rwanda-based datacenters where regulation requires it.
* Provide cloud/hybrid deployment templates with region constraints.

### 9.2 Encryption

* **In transit:** TLS 1.3; mTLS for service-to-service
* **At rest:** DB-level AES-256 encryption; object storage encryption
* **Local DBs:** Isar / SQLite encryption at rest on devices

### 9.3 Secrets Management

* Use a centralized secrets manager (Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, or HashiCorp Vault) for credentials and keys
* Never store secrets in repo or plain `.env` files

### 9.4 Identity & Access

* Centralized IAM with RBAC and fine-grained policies
* OAuth2 / OpenID Connect for external identity brokers
* Short-lived tokens and session revocation

### 9.5 Auditability

* Every critical operation writes an immutable audit event (optionally anchored to a blockchain log for non-repudiation)
* Kafka-based audit topics are retained for regulatory needs

### 9.6 Secure Development

* Use compiled languages (Rust) for sensitive crypto logic
* Regular dependency scanning and SCA in CI
* Regular pen-tests and bug bounty programs for production

---

## 10. Offline-first, Sync & Conflict Resolution

### 10.1 Offline-first Pattern

* Flutter apps use local stores (Isar / SQLite) as single source of truth when offline
* Local writes queued and indexed; sync process attempts to push changes when connectivity is restored

### 10.2 Sync Technology Options

* **CRDTs:** convergent conflict-free replicated data types for automatic merge of concurrent edits
* **Operational Transformations (OT):** for collaborative documents
* **Custom sync:** timestamp + vector-clock conflict resolution with server-side rules

### 10.3 Recommended Approach

* Use Isar's sync capabilities where available for device-level sync
* For complex domain models, implement CRDTs or server-driven conflict resolution rules in Rust microservices
* Always keep a change log and human-reviewable conflict queue for critical data (e.g., land records)

---

## 11. Rust ↔ Dart Integration

### 11.1 Calling Rust from Flutter

* Use `flutter_rust_bridge` to generate idiomatic bindings
* Keep FFI surface minimal and type-safe; prefer simple structs and primitive types
* Implement crypto or high-performance processing in Rust, expose small APIs to Dart

### 11.2 Sharing Models

* Define models in protobuf or a canonical schema language
* Generate Dart models (via `protoc`) and Rust structs (via `prost`) to ensure parity
* Version our schemas and provide migration tools for DB changes

---

## 12. CI/CD, Deployment & Operational Guide

### 12.1 CI/CD Principles

* Pipeline should run tests, linting, SCA, and build artifacts for each language
* Build Rust microservices into static binaries or docker images
* Flutter builds produce mobile artifacts and web/PWA bundles
* Use infrastructure-as-code for reproducible environment deployments (Terraform / Pulumi)

### 12.2 Example Pipeline (high-level)

1. Push to GitHub → GitHub Actions triggered
2. Run linters (dart analyze, clippy)
3. Run unit & integration tests
4. Build Docker images and publish to registry
5. Run security scans (Snyk/Trivy)
6. Deploy to staging via Helm / terraform
7. Run smoke tests & canary rollout to production


### 12.4 Kubernetes (production)

* Use namespace-per-environment (`stanforis-dev`, `stanforis-staging`, `stanforis-prod`)
* Use Helm charts per microservice
* Use a service mesh (Istio) because we need advanced routing and mTLS
* Use Horizontal Pod Autoscalers for microservices with CPU/memory and custom metrics

---

## 13. Development Environment

### 13.1 Local Prerequisites

* Dart & Flutter (stable channel)
* Rust toolchain (stable, plus toolchains for cross-compiling where needed)
* Docker & Docker Compose
* Node.js (for any frontend JS tooling) // but we are focussed more on mobile first version
* PostgreSQL client tools

### 13.2 Recommended VSCode / IntelliJ Setup

* Dart & Flutter plugins
* Rust Analyzer
* Protobuf support
* GitLens & dependency checkers

---

## 14. Coding Standards & Conventions

* Use idiomatic Dart and Rust conventions (rustfmt, dart format)
* Document public APIs with doc comments
* Keep modules small and single-responsibility
* Use feature flags for experimental modules
* Schema-first development: update `.proto`/OpenAPI definitions first, then regenerate clients

---

## 15. Testing Strategy

* **Unit tests** for pure functions and business logic
* **Integration tests** for microservices interacting with test DBs
* **E2E tests** for key user flows (login, data sync, critical admin tasks)
* **Load tests** for Kafka ingestion and analytics pipelines (k6 / Gatling)
* Use mocks for external dependencies in CI

---

## 16. Monitoring, Logging & Observability

* **Tracing:** OpenTelemetry with trace IDs propagated across gRPC and Kafka messages
* **Metrics:** Prometheus exporters and Grafana dashboards per service
* **Logging:** Structured logs (JSON) sent to a central aggregator (Loki / ELK)
* **Alerts:** PagerDuty or Opsgenie integration for critical incidents

---

## 17. Backup & Disaster Recovery

* Regular logical backups for PostgreSQL (pg_dump) and physical backups for Timescale/ClickHouse
* Object storage snapshots for MinIO with cross-region replication if available
* Kafka topic retention policies for auditability; use archive jobs to S3 for long-term retention
* Restore drills quarterly with playbooks and runbooks

---

## 18. Data Respect, Ethics & Governance

This system must follow data protection and ethics principles.

**Key commitments:**

* **Purpose binding:** Data used only for declared purposes
* **Minimization:** Collect the minimum data necessary
* **Transparency:** Public-facing privacy policy and sector-level data uses
* **Consent & Revocation:** Ensure citizen consent flows and revocation APIs
* **Auditability:** Immutable audit trails for sensitive operations
* **Data Access Committees:** Human oversight for research and analytics access

### Final Notes

This project is intentionally ambitious. Treat the repository and its artifacts as a living reference architecture. Start small: shipping a minimal sector (e.g., energy or agriculture) end-to-end (device → edge → kafka → microservice → postgres → dashboard) will prove the pattern and allow iterative expansion.
