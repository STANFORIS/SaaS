Assigned roles & rules for each dependency — STANFORIS system

Below I assign a clear, practical “rule” (purpose + how/where to use it, integration points, security notes, and developer tasks) for each dependency in your list so the team (you & I) can implement them consistently across the platform.

1. Protocols Setup
a) QUIC

Role / Rule: Primary transport layer for low-latency, connection-oriented RPC and client-server communication (HTTP/3).

Where used: Between frontends (Flutter web mobile) and API Gateway, and for gRPC-over-QUIC between edge nodes and backend microservices that need minimal RTT.

Integration: Use QUIC-enabled stacks (HTTP/3) for public endpoints and for performance-sensitive gRPC services.

Security: Native TLS 1.3, keep certificate lifecycle automated (ACME) and enable anti-replay/jitter protections.

Dev tasks: Provide QUIC-enabled endpoints in gateway and performance-critical microservices; provide fallback to HTTP/2 where QUIC unavailable.

b) gRPC

Role / Rule: Canonical RPC for microservice-to-microservice API contracts and typed protobuf schemas.

Where used: All internal microservice comms, service stubs for sector APIs, and SDK generation for frontends (where appropriate).

Integration: Proto-first development workflow; produce language bindings (Rust, Dart, Python) from same proto repo. Run gRPC over QUIC where low latency required, else over HTTP/2.

Security: mTLS between services, token propagation of user identity (JWT with user DI claims).

Dev tasks: Maintain proto/ central repo, CI validation of proto backward compatibility, generate clients for each service.

c) MQTT

Role / Rule: Primary IoT / device telemetry ingress protocol (publish/subscribe).

Where used: Device → Edge → MQTT Broker (HiveMQ/EMQX) ingestion for sensors and field devices.

Integration: Edge preprocessors subscribe to topics, validate messages, and publish to Kafka.

Security: TLS for broker connections, client certs for devices, topic-level ACLs.

Dev tasks: Define topic taxonomy (e.g., /sector/{sector}/site/{id}/telemetry), retention and QoS rules, bridge MQTT → Kafka connector.

d) WebSocket

Role / Rule: Real-time UI channel for push updates and interactive sessions (low-throughput realtime).

Where used: Flutter web and mobile for live dashboards, push notifications, collaborative UIs.

Integration: Gateway (KrakenD) proxies secured WebSocket connections to relevant microservices or to Kafka consumers via connector.

Security: JWT handshake, token refresh, rate limiting, origin checks.

Dev tasks: Define event formats, graceful reconnect and offline sync behavior with local DB.

2. Database Setup (Primary)
a) PostgreSQL

Role / Rule: Authoritative relational store — canonical for identity, tenancy, configuration, RBAC, financial ledgers.

Where used: Digital Identity registry, sector subscription metadata, audit logs that must be relational & transactional.

Integration: Strong ACID transactions, logical replication for HA, partitioning for large tables. Use Postgres as the system-of-record referenced by other DBs.

Security: Row-level security (RLS) with tenant-based policies, DB encryption at rest, nightly backups.

Dev tasks: Schema design for identity domain, migrations (use Diesel/SQLx/flyway), write DB access patterns.

b) SurrealDB

Role / Rule: Hybrid graph/document for relationship-heavy queries and contextualized cross-sector linking.

Where used: Linking identities to institutions, social graphs, complex relationship queries (e.g., family + institution + device relationships).

Integration: Sync denormalized views from Postgres for complex queries; use SurrealDB for graph traversals and relationship-driven features.

Security: Enforce access control layers; limit large write loads.

Dev tasks: Define which relationships live in SurrealDB and build ETL from Postgres for synchronization.

c) MongoDB

Role / Rule: Flexible document store for sector-specific unstructured or semi-structured data (forms, logs, ephemeral records).

Where used: Health reports (unstructured attachments), audit trails, sector microservices with fast schema evolution.

Integration: Use as a secondary store; normalize references to Postgres IDs; use change streams to feed Kafka.

Security: Field-level encryption for PII, index strategy for query patterns.

Dev tasks: Define collection naming per sector, retention policies, and schema-versioning guidelines.

3. Analytics / AI — Stream Processors
a) ClickHouse

Role / Rule: Real-time OLAP for high-volume event analytics and dashboards.

Where used: Event analytics, user behavior dashboards, KPI dashboards, audit metrics.

Integration: Kafka → ClickHouse connector for streaming ingestion; materialized views for common reports.

Security: RBAC on queries, limit ad-hoc queries that are expensive.

Dev tasks: Define event schemas, retention/partition policies, create analytics views.

b) TimescaleDB

Role / Rule: Primary time-series engine for telemetry, IoT metrics, and historical time-series queries.

Where used: IoT telemetry retention, sensor metrics, time-based alerts, ML feature stores.

Integration: Edge → Kafka → Timescale ingestion or direct writes from edge for low-latency; cross-join with Postgres (Timescale is Postgres-compatible).

Security: Protect telemetry that can reveal sensitive operational details.

Dev tasks: Design hypertables, continuous aggregates, retention & downsampling policies.

c) Python / Rust ML modules

Role / Rule: Offline & online model execution for predictions, anomaly detection, and analytics.

Where used: Yield prediction, health risk scoring, fraud detection, telemetry anomaly alerts.

Integration: Stream inference via Kafka consumer (Rust for low-latency, Python for prototyping). Export model endpoints behind microservices; orchestrate model retraining pipelines.

Security: Data governance for training data, model explainability, drift detection.

Dev tasks: Provide model serving infra (gRPC/HTTP endpoints), CI for model validation, monitoring for data drift.

4. Local Database Setup (Mobile / Offline)
a) Isar

Role / Rule: Primary local persistent DB for Flutter (fast queries, binary storage).

Where used: Mobile/offline-first app cache for sector data, user session data, and pending transactions when offline.

Integration: Sync engine (two-way) to push local writes to microservices when online (via KrakenD/gRPC). Use conflict resolution strategy (CRDTs or last-wins with audit).

Security: Encrypt local DB; require device-level auth.

Dev tasks: Define sync schema, implement push/pull sync logic and conflict resolution.

b) Hive

Role / Rule: Lightweight key-value store for small app state and config.

Where used: Preferences, small caches, tokens, ephemeral state.

Integration: Complement Isar for small quick reads.

Security: Encrypted boxes for tokens/PII.

Dev tasks: Standardize keys, TTL, and clear-on-logout rules.

5. Online Database / Object Storage
a) Firebase

Role / Rule: Optional real-time sync and auth fallback for rapid prototyping and scaled realtime features.

Where used: Early POC features, chat or collaboration features, or mobile-first push where low effort real-time needed. Not the canonical identity store.

Integration: Use as secondary real-time channel; sync to Postgres for canonical records. Avoid storing PII exclusively in Firebase.

Security: Strict rules & access control, never rely on Firebase as only auth layer.

Dev tasks: Define migration pathways from Firebase to primary stores.

b) AWS S3

Role / Rule: Object archival and large file storage (documents, imaging, backups).

Where used: Health imaging, large logs, exports, backups, static assets.

Integration: Reference S3 URIs from Postgres/MongoDB; lifecycle rules to move old objects to Glacier. Use signed URLs for access.

Security: Server-side encryption, bucket policies, signed URLs, malware scanning for uploads.

Dev tasks: Define naming conventions, lifecycle/retention policies, and backup procedures.

6. API Gateway Setup
a) KrakenD

Role / Rule: Unified public ingress: authentication, routing, caching, rate limiting, and protocol translation (REST ↔ gRPC).

Where used: All external endpoints: web, mobile, partner APIs. Enforce DI-based auth and sector subscription checks here.

Integration: JWT validation (with DI claims), rate-limits per tenant, response shaping, and transformation for frontend needs.

Security: Central place for WAF rules, throttling, and audit logging. mTLS toward internal services.

Dev tasks: Create gateway configs per environment, schema validation for public responses, automated config deployment.

7. Microservices Communication Setup
a) gRPC

(Already described in 1.b) — Rule: Single canonical RPC channel for typed, versioned internal APIs.

Enforce interface-first development, automatic client generation, and backward compatibility tests.

8. Device / IoT Communication
a) MQTT (HiveMQ)

Rule: Primary ingestion bus for constrained devices. Broker supports persistence and bridging to Kafka.

b) CoAP

Rule: Lightweight constrained protocol for ultra-low-power devices; use at field edge where MQTT not available. CoAP ↔ MQTT bridge on gateway devices.

c) NATS

Rule: Lightweight, high-throughput internal messaging for services that need ephemeral pub/sub (control plane messages, service discovery signals). Not for large event history.

d) ZeroMQ

Rule: Low-level, in-process/out-of-process patterns for internal service-to-service patterns where brokerless messaging is desired (fast point-to-point telemetry between local edge components).

Integration summary for 8: Devices → (CoAP / MQTT) → Edge gateway → MQTT broker → bridge → Kafka → backend consumers. NATS & ZeroMQ used for internal service control flows and low-latency internal patterns.

9. Edge Compute & System Event Bus

Rule: Edge microservices validate, enrich and pre-process telemetry, then publish canonical events to Apache Kafka (central event bus).

Where used: Edge nodes at field sites, gateways, regionals.

Integration: Edge services run Rust microservices for performance; they perform schema validation, sampling, local aggregations, and local alerts before publishing to Kafka.

Security: Edge authentication, signed telemetry, local throttling.

Dev tasks: Define canonical Kafka topics, schema registry (Avro/Protobuf), partitioning strategy, and local failover behavior (disk buffering on network loss).

10. Frontend / Dashboards
a) Flutter (mobile + web)

Role / Rule: Single cross-platform UI framework: entry portal, sector dashboards, microservice admin UIs and service pages.

Where used: All user touchpoints (citizens, developers, admins).

Integration: Each microservice can expose minimal REST or gRPC endpoints; frontends talk to KrakenD (gateway) to enforce DI auth. Use Isar/Hive as local caches for offline. Live-sync via WebSocket or real-time connectors.

Security: Use platform-specific secure storage for tokens, biometric unlock for critical actions. Validate server signatures.

Dev tasks: Create a shared UI component library, offline sync patterns, auth wrapper (DI flows), and sector-specific UI modules.

Cross-component rules & conventions

Proto-first & API contract discipline: All APIs must be defined in proto/ (gRPC) with versioning tags. Backwards compatibility checks in CI.

Identity propagation: Every request carries the digital identity token with sector claims; KrakenD enforces and injects claims for microservices.

Event schemas & registry: Use a schema registry (Avro/Protobuf) for Kafka topics. Enforce schemas in edge and producers.

Zero-trust & mTLS: All service-to-service comms require mTLS and token checks. Secrets in vault (HashiCorp Vault recommended).

Observability: Standardized logging format (structured JSON), distributed tracing (OpenTelemetry), and metrics exported to ClickHouse or Prometheus (for infra metrics).

CI/CD patterns: Automated tests: contract tests for protos, DB migration tests, and smoke tests for gateway configs. Canary deploys for microservices.

Data governance: All PII must be tracked; any PII event must be logged and have retention rules. Encryption at rest for all PII fields.

Sync & conflict policy: Define conflict resolution per domain (financial = strict transactional, sector forms = last-wins with audit, device telemetry = append-only).

Recommended Implementation Order (practical short roadmap)

Digital Identity Registry (Postgres, PKI) — canonical root.

KrakenD + OAuth2 bridge — secure gateway and token issuance.

Proto repo + gRPC infra + CI for proto validations.

Edge → MQTT → Kafka pipeline + schema registry — ingest test telemetry.

Postgres core schemas (identity + tenancy + subscriptions).

Timescale + ClickHouse pipelines — telemetry + analytics.

SurrealDB / MongoDB staging — relationship queries & doc needs.

Flutter Entry Dashboard + basic subscription flow (Isar local cache).

Create first sector microservice (e.g., Health: EHR adaptor) — gRPC service + FHIR adapter + documentation.

Iterate sector-by-sector; add ML modules and expand analytics.
