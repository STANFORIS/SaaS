🧠 STANFORIS Interoperability SaaS Platform
National Digital Twin | Multi-Sector | AI-Powered | Secure-by-Design

Core Concept: A unified national digital infrastructure that begins with a verified Digital Identity, enabling citizens and institutions to access interoperable sector-based services through microservices and modular dashboards. Inspired by the Estonian e-Governance model, powered by Rust, Flutter, Kafka, and gRPC.

🚀 Development Flow
🏁 Phase 1 — Protocols Setup
Protocol	Purpose	Stack/Notes
QUIC	High-speed, low-latency transport (HTTP/3 backbone)	Rust, tonic-quic
gRPC	Core microservice communication	Protocol Buffers + tonic (Rust)
MQTT	IoT/Device message bus	HiveMQ / EMQX
WebSocket	Real-time user communication	Flutter WebSocket Channel
Microservices <== gRPC/QUIC ==> API Gateway <== WebSocket ==> Flutter Frontend
Devices <== MQTT ==> Edge Compute <== Kafka ==> Analytics Engine

🧩 Phase 2 — Database Setup
2.1 Primary Databases
DB	Role	Use Case
PostgreSQL	Relational master	Identity, user sessions, config
SurrealDB	Graph + Relational hybrid	Contextual relationships between entities
MongoDB	Document-based store	Sectoral unstructured data, logs
2.2 Analytics / AI Databases
DB	Role	Use Case
ClickHouse	Real-time analytics	Event ingestion and analytics dashboard
TimescaleDB	Time-series	Telemetry, IoT data, logs
Python/Rust ML Modules	Predictive & AI analytics	TensorFlow, Rust AI crates
2.3 Local Storage (Offline-first)
DB	Role	Use Case
Isar	Local persistent DB	Flutter local cache
Hive	Key-value storage	Mobile/web fast sync layer
2.4 Cloud / Online Storage
Platform	Role
Firebase	Real-time sync and auth fallback
AWS S3	File/object archival
🧠 Phase 3 — API Gateway Setup
Component	Stack	Function
KrakenD	API Gateway	Central routing, caching, load balancing, JWT validation
OAuth2 / OpenID Connect	Auth layer	Connected to National Digital Identity registry
User (DI) --> KrakenD --> Auth Service --> Sector API --> Microservice

⚙️ Phase 4 — Microservices Communication Setup

Core Communication: gRPC over QUIC

Pub/Sub Layer: Kafka

IoT Edge: MQTT + NATS + CoAP

Event-driven orchestration: ZeroMQ for internal system messaging

IoT → MQTT → Edge Compute → Kafka → Analytics/AI
                        ↓
                 Microservice Consumers

🛰️ Phase 5 — Edge Compute & Event Bus
Layer	Function	Tech
Edge Node	Preprocessing telemetry	Rust microservices
Event Bus	Streaming backbone	Apache Kafka
Analytics	AI & Insights	Python + Rust ML
🧱 Phase 6 — Sectorized System Architecture

Each Sector is a modular subdomain with independent microservices and dashboards.



Each submodule communicates via gRPC, publishes events to Kafka, and exposes REST endpoints via KrakenD.

🧭 Phase 7 — Frontend & Dashboards
Layer	Framework	Purpose
Digital Identity Portal	Flutter Web	Login, identity verification
Sector Dashboards	Flutter Web/Mobile	Sectoral analytics and data visualization
Microservice Dashboards	Flutter Web	DevOps, microservice health, telemetry
Service Pages	Flutter Web	Public services, citizen interaction
